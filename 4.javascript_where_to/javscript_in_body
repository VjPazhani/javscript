    points to remember:
     * semi colon in
     
     * writing procedure for function 
     
     * using proper quotations
     
     * Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed,
       because script interpretation slows down the display
     
     * An interpreted language is a programming language which are generally interpreted, 
       without compiling a program into machine instructions. It is one where the instructions are not directly
       executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed by some other program.  
     
     * To make the computer understand, a program can be written using only 0s and 1s.
       The data can also be specified and represented using only 0s and 1s. Such a program is called Machine Language program.
