When i search what is javavscript in browser asusual it display contents and meaning of javavscript
Before  understand  the  javavscript  meaning you will should understand some terms like static and 
dynamic  programming  language, compiler , interpreter , compilation , run time  and  scripting  in 
computer science. Compiler-it  analysis  the  all  source  statements  and  throws  the  error when 
it find   error , if  it  is  zero  error  it  converts  high  level  language   instructions  into 
machine  level  language(1's and 0's) ,it executes whole program .Interpreter is a computer program 
that  directly  executes  instructions  written  in  a programming  or  scripting language, without
requiring them previously to have  been  compiled  into  a machine language program and instruction 
are executed by line by line Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an 
executable code  while  the  run time  is  the time at which the executable code is started running
A statically-typed language is a language (such as Java, C, or C++) where variable  types are known 
at compile time , In most of these languages, types  must  be expressly indicated by the programmer
Dynamic  programming  language  types  are  known run time that means variable types are understand 
by  using   interpretor . Scripting   is  the   process  of  adding   functionality  to  a  certain 
program or  making  a  program  “do something” .  We  could  say  that  scripting is part of coding
Having  understanding with  above computer terms.Now we   moved  to  know about what is javavscript
JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language.  It is lightweight and most commonly used as 
a part of  web pages,  whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and 
make dynamic pages . Client-side JavaScript  is  the  most  common form of the language. The script 
should  be  included  in  or  referenced  by  an  HTML  document  for  the  code  to be interpreted 
by the browser.
